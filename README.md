# mr_benchmark (WIP)

Benchmarking Meshroom with the Monstree dataset

# Windows 10

**default graph and parameters**

You can calculate with 30sec. per image on a computer with i7@2.9GHz, GTX1070 8GB, 32GB Ram.
MR2018 260s
MR2019.1 185s


**MESHROOM_USE_MULTI_CHUNKS=0**

This will reduce the computation time on multi-core machines

i7@2.9GHz, GTX1070, 32GB, computation time reduced by ~20%


# Linux

**Manjaro Linux**

reduces computation time by ~22%

**Ubuntu**

WIP Test different image resolutions and number of images
- memory consumption
- cache folder size
